This is a basic implement for stable-diffusion-webui plugin.

# How to use

`set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--nowebui --cors-allow-origins=http://localhost:3000`  
Then start your webui.
2. Once you see **INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:7861**, means you started webui on api mode successfully.
you can open http://127.0.0.1:7861/docs to double check.
